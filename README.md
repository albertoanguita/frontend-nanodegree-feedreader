To execute the application, run index.html in a browser. From the 9 coded tests, only the 5th should fail

All mandatory tests have been implemented and pass successfully. These tests include comments explaining the new code.


## Additional tests

### RSS Feeds -> are all different

A new test called 'are all different' has been included in the 'RSS Feeds' test suite. This test
checks that all feeds have different name and url values from the others.

This test passes with the current code.

### RSS Feeds -> accept new feed sources

A new test called 'accept new feed sources' has been included in the 'RSS Feeds' test suite. This test
checks that it is possible to use the addFeed function to add a new feed to the list of available feeds.

This test fails with the current code, as there is no addFeed function defined.
